Hello , this is my paint-ish project

This is only a prototype so it is not currently made with the user in mind.

That being said however, you can still use the program if you read the instructions below

To start you have to type the name (not the .png /etc part) and then press enter
For example type "red" and press enter
You should see a red box appear on screen

1) You can drag and drop the red box into the highlighted area in the middle of the screen.
you can also make the box bigger or smaller but clicking on the very edge of the box and dragging outwards (as i mentioned above , this is currently not made with the user in mind)

2) You can press ctrl + s to save the image inside of the highlighted area.
after pressing ctrl + s you can press ctrl + s again or the escape key to cancel
however you can also instead type a file name and press enter to save an image of what is inside the highlighted area.

3) After saving a new image you can also use this image by typing out the file name (again without the .png /etc) and pressing enter

4) Have fun , experiment and create new image and make new images with these images

As i mentioned above , this is only a prototype version that i made for fun only to show the functionality.
